Password-Protect
================
ONE PASSWORD TO RULE THEM ALL.

If you have so many accounts in different websites and want to organize the password then this is the solution for anyone. You just have to remember one password and don't have to remember many passwords. 

This app is password protected. When you install this app for the first time you have no password. Just click on OK. Then just change your password. And this is the only password that you have to remember.

After you login you can save three credentials. The website, Username or email and password. You can save these credentials and look back if you forget your login credentials of the that website. 

Why do you want to save the password with this app?
You have so many accounts in different websites and you always forget what password you had. So just save your login credentials with this app in your smartphone so that you can see your password if you forget whenever you want.

How secure is this app?
It is encrypted with android MODE_PRIVATE. If your smartphone is not rooted then your password cannot be read from any other app. People who have rooted smartphone then this app is not really for you. Because if you save your password than other app can look into the password. So just use this app if your smartphone is not rooted.

Also this app doesnot require any permission to run. If you are a android developer than you may know what Permissions are. So you don't have to worry about your password being stolen. If somebody knows the password of this app than only they can see all of the credentials otherwise It is safe. I recommend you putting secure password to this app.
